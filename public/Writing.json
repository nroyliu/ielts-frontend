A riding path was linked to this road vertically and on the north of the stables. On the north of the road, there was a main house, 2 cottages and a barn from west to east. To the east of the stables was a large field, separated from the riding path with a long fence.\n\n90 years later, while this area remained located on the right side of the original road, so many things had been changed. Firstly, the stables were expanded in size and the site of the original barn had been occupied by an office block. The old riding path disappeared, whereas the main house and the cottages were replaced by a large car park. Finally, the fence had been relocated southward and a new riding path was established right next to the new fence and led to the car park.","content":"***The maps below show Harrison\u2019s Stables in 1920 and in 2010.***\n\n***Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and making comparisons where relevant.***\n\n\nWrite at least 150 words\n\n<div style=\"width:130%\">\n\n![T2 W \u7bc7.png](https:\/\/img.papaen.com\/exam\/question\/8HWJZUc9pbkLaG7hgyJIcqk7ZFqcNaP0.png)\n\n<\/div>","options":[{"option":"A","option_alias":"","text":"A:other rainforests may have originally been planted by man."},{"option":"B","option_alias":"","text":"B:many of the island\u2019s original species were threatened with destruction."},{"option":"C","option_alias":"","text":"C:the species in the original rainforest were more successful than the newer arrivals."},{"option":"D","option_alias":"","text":"D:rainforests can only develop through a process of slow and complex evolution."},{"option":"E","option_alias":"","text":"E:steps should be taken to prevent the destruction of the original ecosystem."},{"option":"F","option_alias":"","text":"F:randomly introduced species can coexist together."},{"option":"G","option_alias":"","text":"G:the introduced species may have less ecological significance than the original ones."}]}]}]},{"id":967,"content":"","paraphrase_content":"","audio_url":"","audio_duration":0,"audio_lrc":[],"groups":[{"id":990,"description":"","content":"","type":91,"mode":0,"can_repeat_option":false,"options":[],"questions":[{"id":18766,"type":91,"answer":"","analysis":"Nowadays, employees in more and more companies are given financial incentives for their extra contribution to their companies. Some people advocate this practice and claim it can enhance the working efficiency.\n\nTheoretically, companies can reap benefits from giving their employees additional bonuses. It is easy to understand that it often boosts the work efficiency of the employees who crave money. This is because it clearly tells the entire staff that as long as they work diligently and create wealth for the company, they will be rewarded. Therefore, many employees who did not work hard may put much more efforts into their jobs, thus improving their outcome.\n\nHowever, although the aforementioned approach seems effective and without negative effects, when operating such a reward system in the real world, employers could be faced with some problems. For instance, the amount of money employers can give their staff is actually subject to many factors, such as the total revenue of the last fiscal year. Therefore, sometimes employees may receive a smaller amount of reward this year, even if they put even more efforts into work than last year, which may have a negative effect on their working enthusiasm. \n\nFrom my perspective, therefore, the amount of extra reward should be limited to a reasonable level. Except for financial incentives, other measures should be also adopted so as to enhance employee\u2019s efficiency. For example, a longer period of holidays is a good choice, which can help employees to temporarily get away from their work and expose themselves to fresh things and environment, so that they can be switched to a happier mood and feel more energetic about their jobs.\n\nIn conclusion, my conviction is that it is a good idea to give employees financial incentives, but the amount should be limited. Beside it, rewarding the employees who have made great contributions to the company a longer period of holiday every year is also a good idea.","content":"***Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money.
