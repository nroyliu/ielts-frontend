{"data":[{"id":963,"content":"## A song on the brain\n*Some songs just won\u2019t leave you alone. But this may give us clues about how our brain works*\n\n**A**\tEveryone knows the situation where you can\u2019t get a song out of your head. You hear a pop song on the radio - or even just read the song\u2019s title -and it haunts you for hours, playing over and over in your mind until you\u2019re heartily sick of it. The condition now even has a medical name \u2013\u2018song-in-head syndrome\u2019.\n\n**B** \tBut why does the mind annoy us like this? No one knows for sure, but it\u2019s probably because the brain is better at holding onto information than it is at knowing what information is important. Roger Chaffin, a psychologist at the University of Connecticut says, \u2018It\u2019s a manifestation of an aspect of memory which is normally an asset to us, but in this instance it can be a nuisance.\u2019\n\n**C** \tThis eager acquisitiveness of the brain may have helped our ancestors remember important information in the past. Today, students use it to learn new material, and musicians rely on it to memorise complicated pieces. But when this useful function goes awry it can get you stuck on a tune. Unfortunately, superficial, repetitive pop tunes are, by their very nature, more likely to stick than something more inventive.\n\n**D** \tThe annoying playback probably originates in the auditory cortex. Located at the front of the brain, this region handles both listening and playback of music and other sounds. Neuroscientist Robert Zatorre of McGill University in Montreal proved this some years ago when he asked volunteers to replay the theme from the TV show *Dallas* in their heads. Brain imaging studies showed that this activated the same region of the auditory cortex as when the people actually heard the song.\n\n**E** \tNot every stored musical memory emerges into consciousness, however. The frontal lobe of the brain gets to decide which thoughts become conscious and which ones are simply stored away. But it can become fatigued or depressed, which is when people most commonly suffer from song-in-head syndrome and other intrusive thoughts, says Susan Ball, a clinical psychologist at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. And once the unwanted song surfaces, it\u2019s hard to stuff it back down into the subconscious. \u2018The more you try to suppress a thought, the more you get it,\u2019 says Ball. \u2018We call this the pink elephant phenomenon. Tell the brain not to think about pink elephants, and it\u2019s guaranteed to do so,\u2019 she says.\n\n**F** \tFor those not severely afflicted, simply avoiding certain kinds of music can help. \u2018I know certain pieces that are kind of \u201csticky\u201d to me\uff0cso I will not play them in the early morning for fear that they will run around in my head all day,\u2019 says Steven Brown, who trained as a classical pianist but is now a neuroscientist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. He says he always has a song in his head and, even more annoying, his mind never seems to make it all the way through. \u2018It tends to involve short fragments between, say, 5 or 15 seconds. They seem to get looped, for hours sometimes,\u2019 he says.\n\n**G** \tBrown\u2019s experience of repeated musical loops may represent a phenomenon called \u2018chunking\u2019, in which people remember musical phrases as a single unit of memory, says Caroline Palmer, a psychologist at Ohio State University in Columbus. Most listeners have little choice about what chunks they remember. Particular chunks may be especially \u2018sticky\u2019 if you hear them often or if they follow certain predictable patterns, such as the chord progression of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll music. Palmer\u2019s research shows that the more a piece of music conforms to these patterns, the easier it is to remember. That\u2019s why you\u2019re more likely to be haunted by the tunes of pop music than by those of a classical composer such as J. S. Bach.\n\n**H** \tBut this ability can be used for good as well as annoyance. Teachers can tap into memory reinforcement by setting their lessons to music. For example, in one experiment students who heard a history text set as the lyrics to a catchy song remembered the words better than those who simply read them, says Sandra Calvert, a psychologist at Georgetown University in Washington DC.\n\n**I** \tThis sort of memory enhancement may even explain the origin of music. Before the written word could be used to record history, people memorised it in songs, says Leon James, a psychologist at the University of Hawaii. And music may have had an even more important role. \u2018All music has a message,\u2019 he says. \u2018This message functions to unite society and to standardise the thought processes of people in society.\u2019","paraphrase_content":"","audio_url":"","audio_duration":0,"audio_lrc":[],"groups":[{"id":980,"description":"Choose the correct

But in climate change, the wood itself sometimes holds the key. Imagine an annual register of a year\u2019s sunshine and rainfall and frost, kept up to date with perfect accuracy almost everywhere south of the tundra and north of the tropics, and available for inspection not just at any time in life but, quite often, for centuries after death. The register is, of course, the annual growth rings of trees. Match the rings from young trees with those from old forest giants and you have a centuries-long measure of the march of the seasons. Match the rings from old trees with old cathedral rafters and you have a still longer chronology - and a science called dendrochronology. \n\n[d[=NO=]]\n**B**\tDendrochronologists, scientists who study the growth of rings in trees, have successfully constructed long tree-ring records by overlapping the patterns of wide and narrow rings in successively older timber specimens. There are now a dozen or so chronologies in the world that date back more than 5,000 years. These records, normally constructed in a restricted area, using a single species of tree\uff0care year-by- year records of how the trees reacted to their growth conditions - an environmental history from the trees\u2019 point of view.\n\n[d[=NO=]]\n**C**  \tBecause tree-ring chronologies are constructed on a regional basis, there has, in the past, been a tendency for dendrochronologists to think local. However, the success of dendrochronology as an international research topic means that there are now quite a lot of chronologies available for study. As the chronologies are dated absolutely, it is possible to compare the records from different areas year by year. Recently\uff0can analysis of 383 modern chronologies, drawn from a vast area across Europe, northern Eurasia and North America was published. The authors, Keith Briffa and colleagues, observed that the maximum late-wood density of the growth rings in each year was related to the temperature in the growing season. Their analysis spanned 600 years, back to AD 1400, and presented a summer temperature record reconstructed from the huge grid of precisely dated ring densities. What they noticed was that the years of really low density - the cool summers - were directly associated with large explosive eruptions, as known from historical sources and from dated layers of acid in the Greenland ice record. Greenland ice is kilometres thick and is made up of the compressed snowfall of tens of thousands of years, so the ice record can be read in almost the same way as tree-rings. I shall use this study as an example of what else tree-rings can tell us.\n\n[d[=NO=]]\n**D** \tThe study provides a year-by-year estimate of temperatures, together with the dates of some major volcanoes. It is a nice clean story - volcanoes load the atmosphere with dust and aerosol and reflect back sunlight, cooling the earth\u2019s surface. This cooling leads to variations in the density of growth rings in northern conifers. Because there are a lot of other records, it is possible to test the findings from the conifer density record.\n\n[d[=NO=]]\n**E** \tWe can, for example, look at what European oak was doing across the same 600-year period. Was oak responding in the same way as the conifers? The \u2018oak chronology\u2019 is the mean of eight regional oak chronologies across a strip of land from Ireland to Poland. It represents how, on average, hundreds of millions of oaks grew. What we see from this comparison is that the oaks clearly do respond to the volcanoes in some cases (in 1602\uff0c1740 and 1816\uff0cfor instance), but nothing like so clearly in others. Immediately it becomes apparent that the conifers tell only part of the story. There are many downturns in oak growth, and only a few are related to the conifer record. The oaks were quite capable of being more stressed in years where the conifers were not affected. The point of this, however, is not to argue about the quality of global cooling; the point is to show what dendrochronology can do.\n\n[d[=NO=]]\n**F** \tTake the case of 1816\uff0ccalled the \u2018year without a summer\u2019 because of the terrible unseasonable cold and the crop failures that ensued. It has long been known that the primary cause of the cooling was the massive eruption of Tambora, east of Java, in 1815. However, there was a lot more going on in the run-up to 1816. Bald cypress trees in Tennessee show a major growth anomaly, with rings up to 400 percent wider than normal, in the years following a huge earthquake in 1811-12 in Eastern America. But there is a volcanic acid layer in several Greenland and Antarctic ice cores in 1809-10, as well as in 1815-16. So here we have a combination of a highly unusual quake in an area of the USA not normally affected by earthquakes, and at least two volcanic eruptions, including Tambora, which is widely regarded as the largest in the last 10,000 years. According to Briffa, the period 1810-20 was the coldest in the last millennium, so we begin to see a combination of three unusual elements in less than ten years - exceptional earthquake, exceptional volcanic eruption, and exceptional cold. Given that the defeat of Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia in 1812 was famously attributed to \u2018General Winter\u2019, one wonders whether a natural series of events actually helped to change the course of modern history.\n\n[d[=NO=]]\n**G**\tObviously, the case of 1816 and the years just before and after it is relatively recent and well documented. However, dendrochronology allows us to investigate the effects of such events geographically, indeed globally. We can interrogate the trees in areas where there is no historical or instrumental record. Further back in time, dendrochronology is almost the only way to reconstruct abrupt environmental events and perhaps throw new light on far darker moments in human history. Were there just political forces at work in the Dark Ages, or did violent natural events also take a hand, tipping the balance by darkening the skies and lowering the temperature? The trees were there too, and kept a record.The wood hewn from them and preserved through the centuries is slowly beginning to yield at least circumstantial evidence that could support some of the stories - think of the Arthurian wasteland, or the plagues of Egypt - so far told only in enigmatic artefacts, or in legends, epics, and religious chronicles.","paraphrase_content":"","audio_url":"","audio_duration":0,"audio_lrc":[],"groups":[{"id":983,"description":"Choose the correct heading for each paragraph and move it into the gap.","content":"#### List of headings","type":34,"mode":342,"can_repeat_option":false,"options":[{"option":"A","option_alias":"i","text":"Looking at a particular decade"},{"option":"B","option_alias":"ii","text":"Studying trees frozen in ice"},{"option":"C","option_alias":"iii","text":"Bringing different studies together"},{"option":"D","option_alias":"iv","text":"Records of different species compared"},{"option":"E","option_alias":"v","text":"What dendrochronology is"},{"option":"F","option_alias":"vi","text":"A war that affected the climate"},{"option":"G","option_alias":"vii","text":"Showing how trees record volcanic activity"},{"option":"H","option_alias":"viii","text":"A unique record of other times and places"},{"option":"I","option_alias":"ix","text":"Local records covering thousands of years"},{"option":"J","option_alias":"x","text":"How tree rings are formed"}],"questions":[{"id":18740,"type":34,"answer":"I","analysis":"\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1athousands of years\n\u5b9a\u4f4d\u539f\u6587\uff1aB\u6bb5 \u201cThere are now a dozen or so chronologies in the world that date back more than 5,000 years.

But now ecologists are being forced to reconsider their ideas*\n\nWhen Peter Osbeck, a Swedish priest, stopped off at the mid-Atlantic island of Ascension in 1752 on his way home from China, he wrote of \u2018a heap of ruinous rocks\u2019 with a bare, white mountain in the middle. All it boasted was a couple of dozen species of plant, most of them ferns and some of them unique to the island.\n\nAnd so it might have remained. But in 1843 British plant collector Joseph Hooker made a brief call on his return from Antarctica. Surveying the bare earth, he concluded that the island had suffered some natural calamity that had denuded it of vegetation and triggered a decline in rainfall that was turning the place into a desert. The British Navy, which by then maintained a garrison on the island, was keen to improve the place and asked Hooker\u2019s advice. He suggested an ambitious scheme for planting trees and shrubs that would revive rainfall and stimulate a wider ecological recovery. And, perhaps lacking anything else to do, the sailors set to with a will.\n\nIn 1845, a naval transport ship from Argentina delivered a batch of seedlings. In the following years, more than 200 species of plant arrived from South Africa. From England came 700 packets of seeds, including those of two species that especially liked the place: bamboo and prickly pear. With sailors planting several thousand trees a year, the bare white mountain was soon cloaked in green and renamed Green Mountain, and by the early twentieth century the mountain\u2019s slopes were covered with a variety of trees and shrubs from all over the world.\n\nModern ecologists throw up their hands in horror at what they see as Hooker\u2019s environmental anarchy. The exotic species wrecked the indigenous ecosystem, squeezing out the island\u2019s endemic plants. In fact, Hooker knew well enough what might happen. However, he saw greater benefit in improving rainfall and encouraging more prolific vegetation on the island.\n\nBut there is a much deeper issue here than the relative benefits of sparse endemic species versus luxuriant imported ones. And as botanist David Wilkinson of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK pointed out after a recent visit to the island, it goes to the heart of some of the most dearly held tenets of ecology. Conservationists\u2019 understandable concern for the fate of Ascension\u2019s handful of unique species has, he says, blinded them to something quite astonishing \u2014 the fact that the introduced species have been a roaring success.\n\nToday\u2019s Green Mountain, says Wilkinson, is \u2018a fully functioning man-made tropical cloud forest\u2019 that has grown from scratch from a ragbag of species collected more or less at random from all over the planet. But how could it have happened? Conventional ecological theory says that complex ecosystems such as cloud forests can emerge only through evolutionary processes in which each organism develops in concert with others to fill particular niches. Plants co-evolve with their pollinators and seed dispersers, while microbes in the soil evolve to deal with the leaf litter.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what happened on Green Mountain. And the experience suggests that perhaps natural rainforests are constructed far more by chance than by evolution. Species, say some ecologists, don\u2019t so much evolve to create ecosystems as make the best of what they have. The Green Mountain system is a man-made system that has produced a tropical rainforest without any co-evolution between its constituent species,\u2019 says Wilkinson.\n\nNot everyone agrees. Alan Gray, an ecologist at the University of Edinburgh in the UK, argues that the surviving endemic species on Green Mountain, though small in number, may still form the framework of the new ecosystem. The new arrivals may just be an adornment, with little structural importance for the ecosystem.\n\nBut to Wilkinson this sounds like clutching at straws. And the idea of the instant formation of rainforests sounds increasingly plausible as research reveals that supposedly pristine tropical rainforests from the Amazon to south-east Asia may in places be little more than the overgrown gardens of past rainforest civilisations.\n\nThe most surprising thing of all is that no ecologists have thought to conduct proper research into this human-made rainforest ecosystem. A survey of the island\u2019s flora conducted six years ago by the University of Edinburgh was concerned only with endemic species. They characterised everything else as a threat. And the Ascension authorities are currently turning Green Mountain into a national park where introduced species, at least the invasive ones, are earmarked for culling rather than conservation.\n\nConservationists have understandable concerns, Wilkinson says. At least four endemic species have gone extinct on Ascension since the exotics started arriving. But in their urgency to protect endemics, ecologists are missing out on the study of a great enigma.\n\n\u2018As you walk through the forest\uff0cyou see lots of leaves that have had chunks taken out of them by various insects. There are caterpillars and beetles around, \u2019 says Wilkinson. \u2018But where did they come from? Are they endemic or alien? If alien, did they come with the plant on which they feed or discover it on arrival?\u2019 Such questions go to the heart of how rainforests happen. \n\nThe Green Mountain forest holds many secrets. And the irony is that the most artificial rainforest in the world could tell us more about rainforest ecology than any number of natural forests.","paraphrase_content":"","audio_url":"","audio_duration":0,"audio_lrc":[],"groups":[{"id":986,"description":"Choose **TRUE** if the statement agrees with the information given in the text,
